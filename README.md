A strong password is crucial for keeping accounts safe from unauthorized access. To assess password strength, several factors are considered:

Key Criteria for Assessing Password Strength  
- Length. A password should be at least 12 characters long. Longer passwords are harder to crack.  
- Uppercase Letters. Including A-Z improves security, making it harder for attackers to guess.  
- Lowercase Letters. Using a-z ensures variety and lowers vulnerability.  
- Numbers. Adding 0-9 increases complexity and prevents predictable patterns.  
- Special Characters. Symbols like @, #, $, %, and & strengthen passwords against brute-force attacks.  

Additional Factors  
- Avoiding Common Words or Personal Information. A password should not include easy-to-guess words like "password" or personal details.  
- Uniqueness. Each account should have a different password to avoid multiple account breaches.  
- Entropy. This measures randomness in a password; higher entropy means better security.
